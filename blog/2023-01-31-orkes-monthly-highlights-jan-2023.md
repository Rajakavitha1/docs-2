Welcome to the first Monthly Highlight blog of the year from Orkes. January was a busy month for the Orkes team, who invested in continuously improving and enhancing our product - Conductor; for our valued customers. 

A new year brings new challenges and opportunities! We kick-started this year with the Conductor Developer Meetup, co-hosted by **Netflix and Orkes**, the first event of the year. What a great beginning üòé!!<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/orkes-monthly-highlights-jan-2023.png" alt="Orkes Newsletter: January 2023 Highlights" width="90%" height="auto" style={{paddingBottom: 40, paddingTop: 40}} /></p>

## Conductor Developer Meetup: Co-hosted by Netflix and Orkes
**Jan 24, 2023: Virtual**

The first event of the year was the ‚ÄúConductor Developer Meetup‚Äù hosted by the Netflix & Orkes team. We were excited to feature Joseph Karp, DevOps Architect from United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) & Viren Baraiya, our CTO, as the speakers. Other panelists included Anoop Panicker, Senior Software Engineer from Netflix; Jeu George, our CEO; & Cherish Santhoshi, our Developer Relations Engineer. 

The meetup began with Joseph sharing the problems they encountered while setting up and bootstrapping new applications that took many independent teams coordinating for 2-3 months. Joseph & team evaluated multiple solutions but ended with each of them having many downsides. The team at UWM was keen on looking for solutions where they could put their processes in well-scoped microservices that allowed them to iterate quickly with the solutions off the ground, up and running super fast. And that‚Äôs where Conductor came in as the right choice. 

Conductor was able to fulfill all the UWM‚Äôs requirements. In particular, the advantage Joseph pointed out with Conductor over other solutions was mainly focused on two functionalities: **error handling & visibility**. The UWM team was able to automate application bootstrapping with Conductor, delivered as a cloud-hosted service by Orkes.

Viren took over the next section of the meetup, where he introduced the new add-on features, which include Webhooks, Secrets & Tags, and demonstrated a live session on them. The meetup concluded with an interactive *Q & A* session with the community.

Don‚Äôt worry if you missed this session; the recording is now available on our YouTube channel.
