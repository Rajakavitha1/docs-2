Let’s dive into the highlights of the most exciting events, product updates, and what we have in store for April. 

## Product Updates

### Create Task Definitions using UI Forms 

Previously, you could create task definitions from the Conductor UI only in the JSON format. With the latest update, you can now create task definitions more visually by filling in built-in forms to input data for creating tasks.
