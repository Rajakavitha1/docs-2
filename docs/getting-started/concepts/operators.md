# Operators

Operators are built-in primitives in Conductor that allow you to define the control flow in the workflow.
Operators are similar to programming constructs such as for loops, switch case, etc.
Conductor has support for most of the programing primitives allowing you to define the most advanced workflows.

## Supported Operators
Conductor supports the following programming language constructs: 

|Language Construct|Conductor Operator|
|---|---|
|Loops|[Do While Task](../../reference-docs/do-while-task) |
|Decision/switch/if..then...else|[Switch Task](../../reference-docs/switch-task)|
|Fork / Parallel execution|[Fork Task](../../reference-docs/fork-task) and [Dynamic Fork Task](../../reference-docs/dynamic-fork-task)|
|Join|[Join Task](../../reference-docs/join-task)|
|Wait|[Wait Task](../../reference-docs/wait-task) and [Human Task](../../reference-docs/human-task)|
|Terminate|[Terminate Task](../../reference-docs/terminate-task)|
