# Access Control

With [Orkes Cloud](https://orkes.io/cloud), your Conductor server may be running in a different hosted environment than your workers.  The APIs to control/run and edit your workflows are exposed on the internet, so restricting access is is needed.

To ensure that all workflow executions & worker tasks are only run by authorized users, Orkes has added a layer of Access Control to all parts of the Orchestration workflow lifecycle.

We've broken our access control documents into 2 sections:

* [Application Access Control](access-control-applications).
* [User and Group Access Control](access-control-users).
