# Step 2: Running Workflows from Code

So far, we have seen how to compose basic workflows and run them from the UI. However more commonly we will be running the workflows
from an application or service. Letâ€™s learn how to do this from our applications. Orkes Conductor platform offers various SDKs in different languages
for integration with applications or services. 

View our documentation on [Conductor Clients & SDKs](/content/conductor-clients) to learn how to import the required dependencies in our applications.

Let's look at some code examples of how to trigger a workflow by it's name.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Java" label="Java">

```java 
StartWorkflowRequest request = new StartWorkflowRequest();
request.setName("<name of your workflow>");
request.setInput(Map.of("amount", 100, "account", "account-id"));
    
String workflowId = workflowClient.startWorkflow(request);
log.info("Workflow id: {}", workflowId);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python" label="Python">

```python
request = StartWorkflowRequest(
    name="<name of your workflow>", 
    input={
        "amount": 100, 
        "account": "<account-id>"
    },
)
workflow_id = workflow_client.start_workflow(
    body=start_workflow_request,
)
print(f'Workflow id: {workflow_id}')
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Golang" label="Golang">

```go
request := model.NewStartWorkflowRequest(
    "<name of your workflow>",
    1,
    "",
    map[string]interface{}{
        "amount": 100, 
        "account": "<account-id>"
    }
)
workflowId, err := workflowExecutor.StartWorkflow(
    request,
)
log.info("Workflow id: ", workflowId)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CSharp" label="CSharp">

```csharp
var request = new StartWorkflowRequest(
    name: "<name of your workflow>",
    version: 1
);
request.Input = new Dictionary<string, object>()
{
    {"amount", 100},
    {"account", "account-id"}
};
var workflowId = workflowClient.StartWorkflow(
    startWorkflowRequest
);
log.info($"Workflow id: {workflowId}");
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Javascript" label="Javascript">

```javascript
const request: StartWorkflowRequest = {
    name: "<name of your workflow>",
    version: 1,
    input: {
        "amount": 100,
        "account": "account-id"
    }
}
const workflowId = client.workflowResource.startWorkflow(
    request
)
console.log("Workflow id: {}", workflowId)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Clojure" label="Clojure">

```clojure
(def request {:name "<name of your workflow>"
              :input {:amount: 100
                      :account: "account-id"}})
(def workflow-id workflow-resource/start-workflow [options, request])
(log/info "Workflow id:" workflow-id)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>



In addition to triggering from code, we can also run them from:

1. [UI - using the Run Workflow feature](/content/videos/run-workflow)
2. [Upon receiving an Event](/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/event)
3. [Upon receiving a Webhook](/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/webhook)
4. [At a Schedule - using the Scheduler](/content/guides/scheduling-workflows)
