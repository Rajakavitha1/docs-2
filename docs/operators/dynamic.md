# Dynamic Task

```json
"type" : "DYNAMIC"
```

The dynamic task allows you to execute one of the registered tasks dynamically at run-time.

## Configurations

### Input Parameters

| Attribute | Description | 
| -- | -- |
| taskToExecute | Accepts the task name to execute. |
| dynamicTaskNameParam | Indicates the name of the task to be called during workflow execution. | 

:::tip Dynamic SUBWORKFLOW‚Äã
If there is a possibility that the task called is a SUBWORKFLOW, you must also add:

```json
 "subWorkflowParam": {
      "name": "workflow_name",
      "version": <workflow version>
    },
```

If **subWorkflowParam** is present, and the DYNAMIC workflow calls a task type that is not a SUBWORKFLOW, these parameters will be ignored.
:::

### Output Parameters

During execution, the DYNAMIC task is replaced in the workflow with whatever task is called dynamically. The output during execution is whatever the output of the called task.

<details><summary>Shipping Courier</summary>
<p>
Suppose in a workflow, we have to decide to ship the courier, but the decision is to be made during execution. The workflow looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "Shipping_Flow",
  "description": "Ships smartly on the basis of Shipping info",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "shipping_info",
      "taskReferenceName": "shipping_info",
      "inputParameters": {
      },
      "type": "SIMPLE"
    },
    {
      "name": "shipping_task",
      "taskReferenceName": "shipping_task",
      "inputParameters": {
        "taskToExecute": "${shipping_info.output.shipping_service}"
      },
      "type": "DYNAMIC",
      "dynamicTaskNameParam": "taskToExecute"
    }

  ],
}
```

The **shipping_info** task generates an output that is used to determine which task is run in the **shipping_task** DYNAMIC task. The line **"taskToExecute": "${shipping_info.output.shipping_service}"** reads the **shipping_service** output from **shipping_info**. In this example, there are two possible outputs, **ship_via_fedex** or **ship_via_ups**.

Here is the workflow with the DYNAMIC task:

Now, assume a workflow execution where **shipping_info** outputs:

```json
{
 "shipping_service": "ship_via_fedex"
}
```

The DYNAMIC task **shipping_task** has been replaced with **ship_via_fedex**:

If the output is:

```json
{
  "shipping_service": "ship_via_ups"
}
```
The DYNAMIC task **shipping_task** has been replaced with **ship_via_ups**:
