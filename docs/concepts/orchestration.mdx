# Why Conductor

Conductor was built to help Netflix orchestrate microservices based process flows with the following features:

* A fully distributed server - ie no single point of failure achieving very high availability.
* Decouple workflows from underlying service implementation, resulting in greater re-use and cleaner services implementations.
* Provide visibility and traceability into these process flows.
* Full operational control over workflows with the ability to pause, resume, restart, retry and terminate.
* Language agnostic, a workflow can have tasks written in multiple languages, use what the most suited for the job.
* Ability to scale to billions of concurrently running process flows.
* Backed by distributed queuing service abstracted from the clients.
* Handle common themes around rate limits, failure handling, concurrent execution control etc.

## Why not peer to peer choreography?
With peer to peer task choreography, we found it was harder to scale with growing business needs and complexities.
Pub/sub model worked for simplest of the flows, but quickly highlighted some of the issues associated with the approach:

Process flows are *embedded* within the code of multiple application.
Often, there is tight coupling and assumptions around input/output, SLAs etc, making it harder to adapt to changing needs.
Almost no way to systematically answer “How much are we done with process X”?
