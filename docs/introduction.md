# What is Conductor?
Conductor is a platform originally developed at Netflix to orchestrate workflows that span across microservices.

Conductor allows developers to build stateful applications using simple, 
stateless code without having to manage the state and complexities of building a distributed application.
Conductor is cloud native and scales seamlessly as your workload grows.

Conductor is an open-source, **Apache 2.0** licensed workflow orchestration framework. 
You can use Conductor to easily build highly reliable distributed applications using the language of your choice.

Conductor removes the complexities of maintaining and propagating the state of the execution while increasing the robustness of the application by natively supporting retries and error handling scenarios. That way you can focus on coding the business logic of your application instead of the complexities of building the distributed ecosystem.

# What use cases can Conductor solve?

Conductor is a general-purpose orchestration engine that is language agnostic and has been adopted widely across
multiple industries, ranging from Media to security to finance and more. Some of the common use cases that have been
solved by Conductor are:
