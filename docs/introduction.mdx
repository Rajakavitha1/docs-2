# Build your first App with Conductor
In this example, we will create a simple 2-step application that has two steps:

```shell
START → Get User Info → Send Email – END
```

To see how to build an application that archives a durable state execution, checkout and run the sample application.

:::info

The example application runs against Orkes Playground at https://play.orkes.io/ which is a free hosted version of Conductor.

Playground requires authentication and access keys to make API calls.  Before you run the application, please make sure to
obtain the access keys and export them as environment variables

:::

## Obtaining Access Keys
//TODO: CREATE A VIDEO AND EMBED A LINK

Follow the steps below to get access keys:
1. Login to [https://play.orkes.io/](https://play.orkes.io/)
2. Navigate to __Applications__ from the left menu
3. Click __Create Application__ button to create a new application, give it a name
4. Open the newly created application
5. Click __Create Access Key__ to create the KEY and SECRET.  A dialog box opens with newly generated Key and Secret.
6. __Important__: Copy and store the Key and Secret in a safe location.  The secret is NEVER displayed again.

## Setup environment
```shell
export KEY=<Your KEY>
export SECRET=<Your SECRET>
export CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=https://play.orkes.io/api
```

## Checkout and Run
