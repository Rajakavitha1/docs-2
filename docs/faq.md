### How to generate an access token?
In Orkes Cloud, there are two ways:
* For testing, use a [token from your dashboard](content/docs/getting-started/concepts/access-control-applications#prototyping).  These expire with your session.
* Create an [application, and use a key/secret to generate a token](/content/docs/getting-started/concepts/access-control-applications#application). These tokens do not currently expire, but this is expected to change.
