# Creating Workflow Definitions

Workflow can be defined as the collection of tasks and operators that specifies the order and execution of the defined tasks. 

## Configurations

You can configure workflow definitions directly via UI and using API. The workflow definitions includes the following parameters:

| Attribute                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name                          | Provide a unique name to identify the workflow. This field is mandatory.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| description                   | Include a description to indicate the purpose of the workflow. This field is optional.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| version                       | You can give versions to the workflow to keep track of the changes. By default, the value is 1.                                                                                                                                                        |
| tasks                         | You can provide the tasks to be executed in the workflow here. If the task type is an operator or a system task, it is handled by the Conductor server. For user-defined/worker tasks, a worker running outside the Conductor environment is required. |
| inputParameters               | Indicates the input values for the workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| outputParameters              | Indicates the output values of the workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| schemaVersion                 | Indicates the version number of the workflow definition schema.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| restartable                   | Set this value to **true** to restart a completed workflow. If restarting a completed workflow can impact the functioning, set this value to **false**.                                                                                                |
| workflowStatusListenerEnabled | Setting this value to **true**, archive the workflow when completed. This would remove the workflow definition from the Redis persistence module. To unarchive, set the value to **false**.                                                            |
| ownerEmail                    | This field will be auto-populated with the userâ€™s email address.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| timeoutSeconds                | Time (in seconds) after which the workflow is marked as TIMED_OUT if not completed after transitioning to IN_PROGRESS status for the first time. No timeout occurs if the value is set to 0.                                                           |
| timeoutPolicy                 | Indicates the condition at which the workflow should time out. It can take any of the following values:<ul><li>**TIME_OUT_WF** - The workflow status is marked as TIMEOUT and is terminated.</li><li>**ALERT_ONLY** - Registers a counter.</li></ul>   |
| failureWorkflow               | Provide the workflow name to be triggered upon a failure of the execution of this workflow.                                                                                                                                                            |

<details><summary>Steps to configure via UI</summary>

1. Navigate to **WORKFLOWS > Definitions** from the left menu.
2. Create a new task by clicking on the **Define Workflow** button.
3. Provide the workflow definition in JSON format:
```json
{
 "name": "Sample_Workflow",
 "description": "Edit or extend this sample workflow. Set the workflow name to get started",
 "version": 1,
 "tasks": [],
 "inputParameters": [],
 "outputParameters": {},
 "schemaVersion": 2,
 "restartable": true,
 "workflowStatusListenerEnabled": false,
 "ownerEmail": "name@example.com",
 "timeoutPolicy": "ALERT_ONLY",
 "timeoutSeconds": 0,
 "failureWorkflow": ""
}
```
4. Once the fields are populated with appropriate values, click **Save** and then **Confirm**.
