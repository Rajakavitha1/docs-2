# Writing Workers

## What Are Workers?

Conductor is built to connect microservices together and orchestrate workflows.  In Conductor's parlance, each microservice is a `worker`.

Each worker is a microservice that is a small autonomous unit. Each worker performs a small, well-defined task.  There are defined input parameters, and the output parameters are also well defined.

You can create your workers in any language. Our [SDKs](/content/docs/how-tos/SDKs) will help speed along the development.
