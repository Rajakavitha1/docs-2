# Integration with CI/CD
Conductor workflows are core part of your application and should be versioned controlled and released similar to the code.

### Conductor Workflows
Workflows have two main components:
1. Workflow definition that is maintained as a file (json or code)
2. Worker implementation used by the workflows

### Workflows
Workflow definitions should be maintained as an independent unit that can be unit and integration tested before releasing to production environment.

For details on how to unit test workflows, see [Unit and Regression Testing Workflows](unit-tests.md)

#### Steps to publish your workflows as part of the ci/cd
:::note Notes
See [Generating Tokens](/access-control-security/applications#generating-token) on how to generate access token for the API requests below.
:::

#### Downloading workflows from Conductor server to check into your version control
1. Download the JSON from the Conductor UI (Download option from the UI)
2. (Alternatively) Use the API to download JSON for the workflow
    ```shell
    # Get the workflow definition given name and version
    GET -H "X-Authorization:<TOKEN>" /api/metadata/workflow/{name}?version=<version>
    ```
    ```shell
    # Retrieve all the workflows
    GET -H "X-Authorization:<TOKEN>" /api/metadata/workflow/
    ```
#### Publish workflows to the Conductor server from your deployment scripts
Inject `ORKES_ACCESS_KEY`, `ORKES_ACCESS_SECRET` and `ORKES_CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL` variables with the appropriate values in your deployment pipeline

The following script cycles through all the workflow definitions in the current folder and uploads it to the Conductor server.

```shell dynamic https://github.com/orkes-io/workflow-cicd/blob/main/src/deploy_workflows.sh section=1 .../src/deploy_workflows.sh



```


### Worker implementation
Workers are your application specific code, and should be maintained, tested and released as any other code releases to production.
